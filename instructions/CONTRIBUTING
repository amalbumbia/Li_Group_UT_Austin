When adding to this repository, please fulfill the following guidelines to ensure that this remains organized properly.

1. Make sure that your file is committed under the correct folder. There are very few cases where the file should remain in the main branch outside of a folder. Existing folders have subfolders. For instance, all student talks and related documents under the same project are grouped in a subfolder under 'undergraduate_talks'.

2. Files should be uploaded as pdfs when possible. This is so that they can be viewed without having to download them. File types in a folder that are docs or ppt should all be placed in a 'downloadables' subfolder.

3. Ensure that your name is on files that you upload. In code scripts, it can be a comment. If your name is not in the body of the file, add your initials in capital letters to the file name.

4. If your work does not fit within an existing folder category, make new folders or subfolders that can house it. Folder naming conventions should be clear and in all lowercase letters.
